### Methodology
This platform only uses a selection of indicators in order to assess the integrity of public procurements and gives a wide range of possibilities to create your own filters that can serve as indicators. Integrity indicators that are referred to on the page of each tender rely on peer-reviewed research conducted within the DigiWhist project that are now used in [OpenTender.eu](http://OpenTender.eu). See more from their [comprehensive review of objective corruption proxies in public procurement article](http://digiwhist.eu/publications/a-comprehensive-review-of-objective-corruption-proxies-in-public-procurement-risky-actors-transactions-and-vehicles-of-rent-extraction/).

For more information on red flags in public procurement, we recommend the [resources made available by the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/red-flags-integrity-giving-green-light-open-data-solutions/).
